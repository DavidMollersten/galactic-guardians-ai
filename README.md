# Galactic Guardians: AI-Generated Space Invaders-Inspired Game

## Overview

Galactic Guardians is a Space Invaders-inspired game created entirely using AI-generated content. This project showcases the ability to, purely based on GenAI technology, put together non-trivial pieces of software.

## Project Description

This game was created as an experiment to implement a Space Invaders-inspired game without writing a single line of code manually. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Anthropic's AI language model, was used to generate and modify all code for the game. Other AI tools were used to create images, background music, and sound effects.

## Tools Used

- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Anthropic's mid-size model, used for ALL coding tasks including game logic, mechanics, and interface
- **Udio**: Generated the background track
- **Midjourney and DALL-E 3**: Created the intro picture and game characters
- **ElevenLabs**: Produced sound effects
- **VSCode**: Development environment for pasting Claude-generated code and implementing its suggestions
- **LiveServer plugin**: For running the game during development

## How to Play

1. Use the left and right arrow keys to move your ship
2. Press the spacebar to shoot
3. Destroy enemy ships to score points
4. Collect power-ups to restore energy
5. Avoid enemy bullets and prevent enemies from reaching the bottom

## Controls

- **Left/Right Arrows**: Move left/right
- **Space**: Shoot
- **P**: Pause/Unpause
- **R**: Restart (when game over)
- **Q**: Quit game

## Conclusions and Future

This project demonstrates the potential for creating fully functional software relying completely on GenAI technology. Without any significant technology breakthrough, I believe it will soon be possible to, in natural language, use your voice as input, and with an iterative approach create potent software of arbitrary size by guiding an AI model to where you want to go. An increased context size would help, but mainly, I believe it is a matter of putting all of the existing AI tools into the same universe. Potentially letting the AI model run the software itself in each step and observe the result and make adjustments, before sharing the result with you as a creator.
